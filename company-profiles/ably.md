# Ably

## Company blurb

The [Ably platform](https://www.ably.io/platform) is a second generation realtime platform, built from the ground up over more than three years to uniquely solve realtime problems of the future, at scale. Ably's customers are using Ably for things like live chat, realtime location tracking, live document collaboration, gaming and elearning. One of Ably's customers even uses Ably for their air traffic control system for drones.

THe unique problems Ably solves include being protocol agnostic, guaranteed message delivery and reliable ordering, massive fan-out or fan-in, and service continuity during network outages and data centre failures. Ably is delivering billions of messages to millions of devices for global companies like Yahoo, Computer Associates and Offerup. We're excited by the fact we're only getting started; we're growing quickly and on course to soon deliver trillions of messages.

We have a developer-first mindset in everything we do. We hide the complexity of our distributed interoperable platform and package it up for developers as a service with a simple API, great documentation and pro-active support.

We're looking to grow our team with great like-minded people.
